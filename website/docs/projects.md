1. Energy Consumption by State: [Website link](https://us-energy-consumption.herokuapp.com/), [Source codes](https://github.com/dtmlinh/Energy-Search-Tool)

This is a search engine of the energy consumption trends in U.S. states that outputs an energy source table and visual representations of consumption trends over time. It uses a [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) web framework to display a search tool interface with data visualization option to look at a particular state or choose to compare with another state its energy consumption patterns and prices in 2017 (the latest year available), as well as historical time series of energy consumption by source. The state-level data for the project was imported from the [U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)](https://www.eia.gov/) website via web scraping and API.
