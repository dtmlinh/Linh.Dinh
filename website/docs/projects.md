## Energy Consumption by State: [Source Codes](https://github.com/dtmlinh/Energy-Search-Tool)

    A search engine of the energy consumption trends in U.S. states that outputs an energy source table and visual representations of consumption trends over time. 
    
    It uses a [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) web framework to display a search tool interface with data visualization option to look at a particular state or choose to compare with another state its energy consumption patterns and prices in 2017 (the latest year available), as well as historical time series of energy consumption by source. The state-level data for the project was imported from the [U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)](https://www.eia.gov/) website via web scraping and API.

## Chicago PM2.5 Levels: [Source Codes](https://github.com/dtmlinh/Air-Quality-Tool)

    A prototype tool which illustrates and compares 3 different PM 2.5 data sources, by day and neighborhood, in Chicago: ELPC community monitoring ([data](https://airqualitychicago.org/)), Environmental Protection Agency public air sample ([data](https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/documents/data_api.html)), Purple Air self-reported ([data](https://www2.purpleair.com/))

    This tool aims to:
    - illustrate the trends of PM 2.5 measurements in the Chicago area for 4 summers: 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020
    - identify days where the discrepancies (in terms of PM 2.5 levels) between AirQuality, EPA, and PurpleAir data are significant and locate the neighborhoods where these discrepancies might be coming from
    - provide a more detailed view into specific neighborhoods, more specifically:
      + locate blocks with much higher average PM 2.5 levels
      + identify hours/time periods with much higher average PM 2.5 levels

## Chicago Housing Prices: [Source Codes](https://github.com/ymericson/ml-project)
    
    A machine learning model that predicts housing prices for 2021 (2 years ahead the latest available data) in Chicago, IL using neighborhood characteristics. 
    
    Our housing price data uses housing sales in 2013 - 2019 from the Cook County Assessor's Office, aggregated at the Census block group level. Our features include data on demographics, crime, distance to public transit, and more. The purpose of our model is to predict housing price trends in neighborhoods across Chicago, in order to help the city government better predict the areas where housing prices is expected to rise. More advance notice on housing price trends can help the city assess areas where affordability is expected to be more of an issue, so that they can focus resources for affordable housing.

## Food Inspection API: [Source Codes](https://github.com/mrmauer/food_inspection)
    
    A web service that will take input JSON data as a POST request and store the data an database. In addition, the web service will handle GET requests to return information that is generated by querying the database.
