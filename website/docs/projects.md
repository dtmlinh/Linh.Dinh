1. Energy Consumption by State: [Source Codes](https://github.com/dtmlinh/Energy-Search-Tool)

    The project is a search engine of the energy consumption trends in U.S. states that outputs an energy source table and visual representations of consumption trends over time. It uses a [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) web framework to display a search tool interface with data visualization option to look at a particular state or choose to compare with another state its energy consumption patterns and prices in 2017 (the latest year available), as well as historical time series of energy consumption by source. The state-level data for the project was imported from the [U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)](https://www.eia.gov/) website via web scraping and API.

3. Chicago Housing Prices: [Source Codes](https://github.com/ymericson/ml-project)
    
    The project is a machine learning model that predicts housing prices in Chicago, IL using neighborhood characteristics. Our housing price data uses housing sales in 2013 - 2019 from the Cook County Assessor's Office, aggregated at the Census block group level. Our features include data on demographics, crime, distance to public transit, and more. The purpose of our model is to predict housing price trends in neighborhoods across Chicago, in order to help the city government better predict the areas where housing prices is expected to rise. More advance notice on housing price trends can help the city assess areas where affordability is expected to be more of an issue, so that they can focus resources for affordable housing.
