I'm pursuing an [M.S. in Computational Analysis and Public Policy](https://capp.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago, where I study computer science, data science, and public policy. See [Projects](https://dtmlinh.github.io/Linh.Dinh/projects) for some cool school projects I did while in the program.

My interests lie in the applications of data science and machine learning methods that aim to address healthcare and environmental issues. I'm currently a value-based payment models intern at the University of Chicago Medicine. In this role, I create reportings and dashboards to support various value-based health programs.

Previously, I was an analytics lead at Everquote, an online marketing startup in Cambridge, MA, where I used analytics to propose and drive successful marketing strategies. Before that, I was a senior analyst at Compass Lexecon, an economic consulting firm in Washington, DC, where I investigated and analyzed data to better understand and formulate critical arguments used in regulatory proceedings.
