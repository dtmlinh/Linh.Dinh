I'm currently studying data science and public policy in the [M.S. in Computational Analysis and Public Policy at The University of Chicago](https://capp.uchicago.edu/).

My interests are the applications of data science and machine learning methods that aim to address healthcare and environmental issues. I am currently a value-based payment models intern at the University of Chicago Medicine. In this role, I create reportings and dashboards to support various value-based health programs.

Previously, I was an analytics lead at Everquote, an online marketing startup in Cambridge, MA, where I used analytics to propose and drive successful marketing strategies. Before that, I was a senior analyst at Compass Lexecon, an economic consulting firm in Washington, DC, where I investigated and analyzed data to better understand and formulate critical arguments used in regulatory proceedings.
